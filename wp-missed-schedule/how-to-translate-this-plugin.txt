GlotPress translations was not supported from this plugin because:

1 - Translation links exposes the plugins to pushing malicious url.
2 - Translation description exposes the plugin to change its original meaning.
3 - The approval process is too long.
4 - Editors may approve or disapprove according personal rules or motivations.
5 - Not all GlotPress Editors respect plugin Authors directions.
6 - Changing the content of the plugin, makes useless all the previous approval
    process, returning a translation, which no longer conforms to the original
    content.
