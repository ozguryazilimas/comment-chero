== Description ==

Comment Image Embedder is a very simple plugin that, once installed, lets your visitors add an image to their comments.

Itâ€™s rather common for a WordPress user to ask how visitors can embed images in the comments section of their blogs.

This plugin will add a link just below the comment box that a user can click on. When clicked, a prompt will appear for the user to enter the URL of the image. It will then be added to their comment.

= How do I fix the image size? =

Using your stylesheet, you can adjust the height and width of the images that are displayed. If, for instance, you want the maximum width to be 200 pixels, you can use the CSS max-width property like so.

`.comments img {
	max-width: 200px;
}`

*Check the comments container id or class for what to use in place of '.comments'
