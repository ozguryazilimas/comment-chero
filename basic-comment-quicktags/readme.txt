Make commenting easier with bold, italic, add link and quote buttons on top of the form.

== Description ==

This plugin displays the most basic of quicktag buttons on your comment forms, using the Quicktag API built into WordPress (as of 3.3).

You can turn these on and off for bbPress or comments on the discussions page (see the screenshots). Please note, the plugin defaults to <em>off</em>, so you have to go turn them on. Auto-activating isn't nice, as it may conflict with other plugins.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did you do this? =

MarcTV did it because he needed a simple plugin to do this job and decided to do it on his own. I kind of love him for that.

I forked it so I could extend it to bbPress, put in more checks and ifs/thens, and all the other toolbars were too heavy.

= Why only those tags? =

After careful consideration, and a long review of my users, those are the only ones they ever use! If you have a reasonable argument why I should add in others, I'll listen. Thus far, the only suggestion interesting was 'code' and I determined people won't use that unless they know about it, and thus are capable to entering it manually.

= Will you add in options to pick and chose our tags? =

No. I don't have a need for it, and I don't want to include code I'm not going to personally make use of. It makes it much harder on me to support it later. (Read <a href="http://www.sohar.com/proj_pub/download/COMPAS93.pdf">Herbert Hecht's article "Rare Conditions – An Important Cause of Failures"</a> to understand my views on including rarely used code. tl;dr: I try not to.)

= Does this work on Multisite? =

Yes. It can be network activated or per-site, works fine.

= This isn't showing up on bbPress! =

If you're using the bbPress Fancy Editor, it won't work. Really, the fancy editor is 'more' than this, so you shouldn't be using both.

= Will you expand this to BuddyPress? =

Not at this time.
